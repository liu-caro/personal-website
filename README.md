# About

Hello! Welcome to the repo for my personal website. Here I want to showcase some of my experience and projects as well as provide an environment for me to play with new technologies and experiment as well as learn more!

# Setup

If you want to run this website locally, ensure that node and npm are installed! Then it is as simple as downloading the dependencies with `npm i` and then running with `npm run start`! It should create a web application on port 3000.
